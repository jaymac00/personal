This project is a web application for personal use.
The core goal is to create a fighter randomizer from the complete roster of Super Smash Bros Ultimate.
As time goes on, I intend to expand the functionality to allow for more customizable randomization for various common purposes;
	these may include, but will not be limited to ironman challenges and smashdowns.
